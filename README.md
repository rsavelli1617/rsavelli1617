## I’m Raphaël Savelli, a scientist and data wrangler based in Los Angeles. 

By day, I dive into multi-dimensional datasets to understand land–ocean carbon fluxes, building data-model frameworks that inform climate policy, resilience planning, and carbon dioxide removal strategies. By night, I watch B‑movies where the stakes are high, the monsters are delightfully fake, and someone inevitably yells, “We’ve lost control of the experiment!”

With a background that blends science and business management, I thrive at the intersection of complexity and creativity — tackling messy problems like a hero in a low‑budget space opera. I have a deep appreciation for data visualization and design, and I love crafting charts that tell compelling stories, making complex results as captivating as a well‑designed movie poster.

Originally from rural France, I carry a lifelong fascination with nature and a sense of humor about the human one. If you’re passionate about data, carbon cycles, or movies that walk the line between cult and catastrophe, we’ll get along great.
